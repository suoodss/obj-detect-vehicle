# obj-detect-vehicle
This project was for an Intro to Robotics class. It presents a simple approach to object detection that utilizes machine learning 
algorithms through a robot that employs real-time detection of various objects and adjusts its actions, accordingly, demonstrating specific 
behaviors based on the detected objects. For this project, we used a Raspberry Pi 4, an Arduino Uno, a L293D motor driver, an RGB camera, a 
wireless power supply, and a simple chassis developed by Cokoino that has four DC motors connected to rubber wheels
